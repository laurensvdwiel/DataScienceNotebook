# DataScienceNotebook
Example on how to construct R and Python notebooks within docker, requiring no 
(changed) to Python or R on host system.

## Software Requirements

The DataScienceNotebook has been tested in a Linux-based OS x64_86 system
(tested on Ubuntu 18.04) and a MacOS (13.x) apple-silicon system.
It is fully containerized in docker it should, in theory, be possible to run it on any other OS.

Please ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

	docker

You can get docker [here](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)

## Running the notebook
First, make sure you are in the root directory of this github folder.

1. Building the custom docker enironment for this jupyter notebook.

```
docker build -t datascience-docker .
```

2. To start the jupyter notebook:
```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work --name datascience_notebook datascience-docker
```

3. Next, you can access the notebook on your machine by clicking on the link generated by the following command:

```
docker exec -it datascience_notebook bash -c 'jupyter notebook list' | grep http | cut -f1 -d ' ' | awk '{sub(/8888/, "8888")}1'
```

## Shutting the jupyter notebook down:

```
docker stop datascience_notebook
```

To remove the jupyter notebook docker container:
```
docker rm datascience_notebook
```
